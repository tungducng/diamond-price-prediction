# read the setup.MD to setup for Diamond Price Prediction Web Application

This web application is designed to predict the price of diamonds using machine learning models. The app uses Flask as the backend framework and allows users to input various diamond attributes (such as carat, cut, color, clarity, etc.) to receive price predictions based on different machine learning models.

## Models Used

The models used in this application include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**

These models are trained on a dataset of diamonds and are used to predict the price of a diamond based on the input features provided by the user.

## Description

The **Diamond Price Prediction Web Application** is a full-stack web application built using **Flask** and **Machine Learning**. It aims to provide users with predictions for diamond prices based on several key features, including:

- **Carat:** The weight of the diamond.
- **Cut:** The quality of the diamond's cut.
- **Color:** The color of the diamond.
- **Clarity:** The clarity of the diamond.
- **Depth, Table:** Additional attributes that influence the diamond's overall appearance and value.
- **X, Y, Z:** Physical dimensions of the diamond.

This application leverages **big data** techniques by using a large dataset of diamonds, which is cleaned and processed to train models that predict prices. The models are built using various machine learning algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**, and are saved as pickled files (`.pkl`) for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** Backend framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **pandas & NumPy:** Data processing and manipulation.
- **scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for training models and making predictions.
- **HTML/CSS/JS:** Frontend technologies for creating the user interface.
